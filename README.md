> Previous version of this repo (cross-chain NFT minting) has been moved to the [cross-chain-nft-minter-example branch](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/ccip-cross-chain-nft/tree/cross-chain-nft-minter-example).

A cross-chain NFT is a smart contract that can exist on any blockchain, abstracting away the need for users to understand which blockchain theyâ€™re using.

## Prerequisites

-   [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation)

## Getting Started

1. Install packages

```
forge install
```

Or:

```
forge install foundry-rs/forge-std --no-commit
forge install OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts --no-commit
```

And:

```
npm install
```

2. Compile contracts

```
forge build
```

3. Create a new file by copying the `.env.example` file, and name it `.env`. Fill in with Ethereum Sepolia and Arbitrum Sepolia RPC URLs using either local archive nodes or a service that provides archival data, like [Infura](https://infura.io/) or [Alchemy](https://alchemy.com/).

```
ETHEREUM_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=""
ARBITRUM_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=""
```

4. Run tests

```
